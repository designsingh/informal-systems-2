# **üöÄ What will I be doing?**

We are looking for an experienced designer who is resourceful and willing to experiment, who is energized by the idea of creating something out of nothing. *We‚Äôve designed the powerful car engine, now you get to design the exterior.*

You will be a critical part of the team bringing our work out of the CLI into an interface. You need not have specific startup experience, but be able to represent these innate qualities through self-initiated projects, where you've had to consider the project components spanning user needs, business goals & technical feasibilities beyond just design artifacts.

- Act as a leader for the Product Design discipline, collaborating with engineers, researchers and product owners
- Work through design problems from beginning to end: translating research insights into ideas that form new products and features, then designing the workflows and detailed interactions to realize them
- Sketch and prototype ideas to quickly access viability, and design the fine grained details of interactions
- Iterate based on feedback from the whole team and community at large
- Work closely with engineers as they build and ship software
- Own the success or failure of their design work and initiate design and engineering sprints to improve shipped work
- You will be designing front ends and UIs for critical products within the Cosmos ecosystem that enable the growth of thousands of interconnected blockchains

# ‚ú® **What skills do I need?**

- Experience designing digital products and systems, not just websites. You have helped ship products (be it on your own or as part of early stage teams).
- Experience designing unifying experiences tying marketing communications to digital products to more service based interactions.
- An appreciation of the entire product development process, from problem solving through to detailed UI and visual design
- The ability to create high-fidelity mockups of your designs using Sketch, Figma, etc
- Excellent communicator of design work and your rationale behind proposals
- Excellent self starter who can deeply collaborate with engineers

**Nice to have:**

- The ability to create prototypes using Framer, Keynote, HTML/CSS/JS, etc
- Experience with JavaScript development frameworks (i.e. node.js, vue.js)
- Building websites from the ground up that host mixture of static and dynamic content
- Experience with external Content Management Systems (CMS) (i.e. Ghost)
- Blockchain experience is a plus!

We're looking for a portfolio that clearly outlines the problems you were
tackling with your design work. It should touch on the process you applied
to tackling the challenges, rather than focusing just on visuals and landing
pages. Your portfolio should be well structured and clear. Your experience
should ideally focus on designing software products. **Share your
portfolio** along with the other information requested in our [application
instructions](#to-apply).
