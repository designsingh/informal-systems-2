- Lead the recruiting and talent acquisition such as writing job descriptions, proactively sourcing high-quality candidates, reviewing applicants, scheduling, and conducting reference checks

- Guide our organization in developing and welcoming, inclusive, and sustainable culture.

- Own and maintain the applicant tracking process and software.

- Work with the leadership team to understand current and future hiring needs to build a hiring pipeline for future needs

- Understand hiring managers pain points, motivations, business contexts and the roles required to scale their teams

# What we look for in a successful Talent and People Operations Manager:

- 5+ years of relevant work experience with scaling tech companies
