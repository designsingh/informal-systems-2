Informal is a core contributor to [Cosmos](https://cosmos.network/),
where we develop interoperable blockchain systems by heavily relying on
formal verification tools and techniques (formal specification in TLA+, symbolic
model checker Apalache, Model Based Testing Framework, etc).

The Cosmos technology stack, including Tendermint Core, the
Cosmos-SDK, IBC, and the Cosmos Proof of Stake modules, is an industry leading Go toolkit
for building, deploying, and running blockchains.
This technology is used today to secure many billions of dollars in cryptocurrency market capitalization.

One such blockchain is known as the Cosmos Hub, with its native ATOM token. Launched in 2019, the Cosmos Hub
was one of the first production Proof-of-Stake blockchains, and today has one of the largest and most decentralized validator sets
in the blockchain ecosystem. It is central to the Cosmos community as the
blockchain focused primarily on providing a high security environment for
connecting into the emerging Internet of Blockchains - the interchain.

The Cosmos Hub is where development of IBC, the Interblockchain Communication protocol at the
heart of the Cosmos vision, is being pioneered.
The Cosmos Hub has an agressive roadmap to improve the usability and security
of IBC over the coming years. Its goal is to provide a high security base-layer environment
to service the needs of the many dozens (and eventually hundreds and
thousands) of IBC enabled blockchains by providing interoperability services -
making it easy to launch new chains, to connect with many chains from a
single integration point, to simplify access to diverse interchain services
like liquidity and other DeFi applications, and more. For more on  the vision of the Cosmos Hub, see the blog post,
