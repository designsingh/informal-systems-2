jobTitle: 'Product Manager - Hermes'
description: |
  We are a lead developer of the [Inter-Blockchain
  Communication (IBC)](https://ibcprotocol.org/) protocol, an open-source,
  general purpose protocol platform for communication and coordination between heterogenous
  distributed ledgers. The design of IBC reflects the key values of the
  [Cosmos Network](https://cosmos.network): Sovereignty and Interoperability.

  We're developing Hermes, an IBC relayer service written
  in Rust. Relayers are the engine of IBC: event-driven, permissionless
  processes that keep communication and coordination flowing between blockchains.

  As the Product Manager for Hermes, you'll drive the product roadmap and own
  the user experience of a key component of the infrastructure for the Internet of Blockchains.
