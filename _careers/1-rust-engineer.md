Informal is a core contributor to [Cosmos](https://cosmos.network/),
where we develop interoperable blockchain systems by heavily relying on
formal verification tools and techniques (formal specification in TLA+, symbolic
model checker Apalache, Model Based Testing Framework, etc).

The Cosmos technology stack, including Tendermint Core, the
Cosmos-SDK, IBC, and the Cosmos Proof of Stake modules, is an industry leading toolkit, written in Go,
for building, deploying, and running community owned decentralized networks.
This technology is used today to secure many billions of dollars in cryptocurrency market capitalization.

However, many of these components were designed in 2016, back when the Cosmos vision of an "Internet of Sovereign, Interoperable Blockchains" was but a dream.
Today, it is rapidly becoming a reality, and with it, a new set of
requirements and tremendous learnings about the technology stack necessary for
the next 5 years. We are building this stack in Rust, including many of the
key components of the Cosmos ecosystem, but designed more natively for a
multi-chain reality. This includes [Hermes](http://hermes.informal.systems/), the leading IBC relayer for communication between blockchains, as well as
a new multi-chain consensus node based on Tendermint and a new framework for
developing secure and verifiable applications in Rust.
