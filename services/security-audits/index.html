                    We are a team of distributed systems and protocol experts
                    that is known for uncovering hard to find bugs and errors in
                    code and protocol. We have profound expertise in protocol
                    design, implementation, and analysis in the blockchain
                    ecosystem, with origins in Tendermint and Cosmos as well as
                    academic research on Byzantine fault-tolerant systems.

                        During code inspections, we manually analyze the source
                        code for the purpose of reconstructing the underlying
                        protocols. The code serves as the ultimate source of
                        truth as we find it quite often diverges from
                        specifications. Vulnerabilities are often found in
                        codebases due to a number of reasons, including:

                        Protocol errors and bugs surface when protocol rules are
                        violated when software runs in production. We perform
                        audit activities to uncover these behaviours. These

                    Our team has decades of collective experience in academia
                    and in industry in model checking distributed protocols. We
                    are the architects and maintainers of Apalache &mdash; a
                    user-friendly automated formal verification tool we leverage

                        Model checking is known for unveiling
                        unforseen edge-cases in protocols. In “adversarial testing” we
                        turn these edge cases into tests. Without advanced and proper
                        adversarial testing, blockchains can suffer a number of errors
                        that pose a risk to user funds and instill distrust in the
                        system. In these cases, blockchain consensus engines halt and
                        protocol crashes occur.

                        We perform vulnerability searches by constructing TLA+ models
                        which we leverage for code-specific test drivers. Through this
                        process, we generate and execute massive adversarial test suites.

                        Protocols running in production often involve several
                        distinct actors which can result in deep protocol
                        errors. We construct abstract formal protocol
                        descriptions in TLA+ in order to specify the system and
                        its properties. We formalize desired protocol properties
                        as safety invariants and liveness properties, and try to
                        prove/disprove them using our in-house model checking
                        techniques.

                    We generate test cases for the software
                    that we audit directly from TLA+ specifications. This greatly
                    augments manually created test cases with automatically
                    generated ones derived from a formal model. These model-based

                Apalache is a symbolic model checker for TLA+ used to formally
                verifying distributed system protocols, which secure and
                transmit real-world value. Informal Systems has been actively
                developing Apalache with a focus on usability and integration
                with modern software development practices. Apalache is the
                brain-child of Igor Konnov and Josef Widder who leveraged years
                of academic research on formally verifying distributed systems
                to develop this powerful tool.
