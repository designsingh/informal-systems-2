# **An Opportunity to Advance in a Time of Distress**

The current COVID-19 pandemic has sent markets in flux and pushed our global economies into distress. Governments are looking for solutions to stop the spread, businesses are doing whatever they can to keep employees safe while retaining profits margins, and central banks are working to stabilize markets by injecting new money into circulation. The world is collectively facing many challenges with the need to focus on our health, our families and our communities.

Looking forward, this unforeseen pandemic has shown us that many of the ways we work, communicate and govern systems are highly fragile. This crisis has highlighted the need for self-sufficiency in local economies in order to create stability. We are at an inflection point of change, as we see our current systems falter, we expect to see both technological and social changes emerge from this pandemic.

**Informal Systems** and **Penrose Partners** are coming together to discuss the **Past, Present, and Future of the Global Financial System** in the context of this global pandemic. They will be discussing what we can learn from this global crisis and how blockchain technologies may improve our societies and drive change in the future.

Based in Toronto, the teams behind Penrose Partners and Informal Systems have been researching and building blockchain technology for years, and will be sharing their insights on how blockchain technologies can help bring change into our current government, business and social systems.
